# Probability and Statistical Inference

**01) Rulette Simulation** - Simulated Martingale Strategy and proved the strategy does not always bring profits.  

**02) Monte Carlo Error** - Explained the concepts of absolute error and relative error when estimating probabilities from simulation. Demonstrated MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MRE(Mean Relative Error) by sample size and the real probability.

**03) Discrete Probability Calculation** - By using Bayesian Theorem and negative binomial distribution, demonstrated the probability related to World Series game in several different situations.

**04) Home Field Advantage** - Compared the probability that a team win the game with and without home field advantage by using simulation.

**05) Log Transformation** - Introduced the concepts of Normal Distribution, Gamma Distribution, and the log distribution for each. Explained Probability Density Function(PDF), Cumulative Distribution Function(CDF), Estimated Cumulative Distribution Function(ECD). Demonstrated that if Xi > 0 for all i, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometri mean using simulation.

**06) Order Statistics** - Demonstrated the order statistis and showed a QQ plot for the simulated data of the median relative to the known sampling distribution of the median.

**06) MLE and MM** - Explained how to use Maximum Likelihood Estimation(MLE) and Method of Moments(MM) to model Glycohemoglobin and Height of adult females. The data is from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2010.

**07) Coverage Probability** - Performed a simulation to calculate the coverage probability of the 95% confidence interval of the median and explained it step by step.
